## Dixie 计划：简介

前段日子在父亲的遗物硬盘里无意间发现了他以前在博客大巴（BlogBus）发布的博文的备份文件。上网搜了很久，发现博客大巴已经宕了有段时间了，而且把备份的文档转到 WordPress 上也得花不少劲。正好半个月前刚写完我的[个人网站](ss16118.github.io/siyuans-hub/)，所以当时脑子里冒出的第一个想法就是我要亲手帮他重新把这个博客给搭起来。要说契机嘛，无非是《寻梦环游记》给我留下的印象比较深。电影的主题之一大概是一个人一生中要死三次，真正的死亡是被所有的人忘记。David Eagleman 有一句很花哨的 quote，就是

> There are three deaths. The first is when the body ceases to function. The second is when the body is consigned to the grave. The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your name is spoken for the last time.

生活在信息时代，人人都知道互联网是不会忘记任何东西的，（虽然有点讽刺的是很多人放在博客大巴上没有备份的博文的确是丢了），所以我也想让父亲当年的记忆和文字永远的在这个网站上存活下去。

关于这个项目的名字也是想了很久，一开始考虑过两个，一个是**拉撒路计划**，另一个是 **Resurrection by Reconstruction**。仔细斟酌后感觉前者有点太中二，很 cliche，而且太过宗教化，后者又是一个少儿不宜的 reference （来自于 Powerwolf 的一首歌），怎么想都不是很合适。找了一圈以后选定了这个 Dixie 计划，是一个很 Geeky 的梗（感兴趣的话参考一下《神经漫游者》），我觉得放在这儿也特别应景。

简单介绍一下这个网站吧，目前这里保存着父亲从 04 年开始到 08 年之间在博客大巴上发布的所有博文，分类的话有时间和标签两种，也可以进行关键词搜索。虽然以前的评论都有保存下来，但现在不支持添加新的评论。比较可惜的是文章里头的大部分照片是存在博客大巴上的，所以链接都失效了，能显示出来的都是父亲存在[flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/34753848@N00/)上的，在国内也得翻墙才能看。网站的 host 暂时用的是 Github，域名也是 github.io。以后希望能把这个网站拓展成父亲生前兴趣爱好的完整档案，有条件了一定得找个更好的 host 然后再给这个网站单独买个域名。当然这都是以后要干的事了，短期内除了修修 Bug 外网站应该是不会有改动的。

说到底想做这个项目也许只是我个人的自我满足而已，毕竟有可能肉体的死亡就代表了意识和一切的消亡。谁也不知道生命的另一端到底是什么，像哈姆雷特里说的那样，死亡就是”the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns“。但是我还是由衷地希望这个网站能成为《神经漫游者》里 Dixie Flatline 或是《基地》里银河百科全书那样的存在。最后，如果你无意间发现了这个网站，希望你能记住这是世界上最好的父亲，我的父亲，董浩云，在这里留下的痕迹。

## The Dixie Project: An Overview

A while back, I found haphazardly in my late father's hard-drive a backup file that contains a complete copy of his old blog. This blog of his was published on BlogBus, a somewhat ancient Chinese blog hosting provider. I searched around on the Internet and found that BlogBus has been out of service for a while now, and it is quite troublesome to transfer the backup file to WordPress and set up a new blog there. Since I sort of finished my [personal website](ss16118.github.io/siyuans-hub/) about two weeks ago, the first thing that came into my mind was I would like to rebuild my father's blog by myself. Well, if you ask me why do I even bother, my answer will be that the Movie "Coco" has been a memorable film to me. I remember clearly that one of the themes (morals) in the movie is that a person dies three times in his or her life, and no one truly dies unless he or she is forgotten by everyone (something like that). Or, if you want me to be fancy, there is a quote from David Eagleman that says the same thing:

> There are three deaths. The first is when the body ceases to function. The second is when the body is consigned to the grave. The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your name is spoken for the last time.

Living in the digital age, I believe that we are quite familiar with the saying that the Internet never forgets (although I would say it's pretty ironic that a lot of people's blog were kinda "forgotten" along with the downfall of BlogBus and its hosting service), and I want this site to be a place where my father's memories and words can live forever.

Believe it or not, I have actually given the name of this projects a lot of thoughts. I had several alternatives, one of which was **The Lazarus Project**, and the other was **Resurrection by Reconstruction**. After some contemplation, I felt the former was a bit too chuuni, fairly cliche, and too religious, and the latter was a reference to a song (by Powerwolf) that is bit too sexual for this circumstance. In the end, I felt "the Dixie Project" is kind of adequate. Well, it is a Geeky reference to one of my favorite sci-fi cyberpunk books, Neuromancer.

This website now stores all of the blog entries that my father published on BlogBus from 2004 to 2008. The entries are sorted by dates and by category, and you can search for posts by keywords as well. Although the comments under each entry are all displayed as they were, you can't leave any new comments. It is quite a shame that all the photos that were saved on BlogBus servers are lost. The links to images that are currently working are hosted on my father's [flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/34753848@N00/), which sadly, are not accessible to visitors in mainland China (unless you use VPN of course). This website is currently hosted on Github with github pages. In the future, I wish to extend this site to a complete archive of all of my father's interests and hobbies (which, I gotta say, are quite a lot), and probably host the contents on another platform. If conditions permit, I hope to buy a domain name for this site as well.These, however, are things that I plan to do, it is most likely that there won't be any changes here in the foreseeable future, except for bug fixes.

Frankly speaking, maybe I started this whole thing only to gain personal satisfactions, since it is probably true that everything returns to dust and ashes along with your flesh. It is an unfortunate fact that nobody really knows what happens when our lives come to an end, like Shakespeare said in Hamlet, death is "the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns". Yet, I sincerely hope this website, although insignificant, can become the Dixie Flatline in Neuromancer or something like the Encyclopedia Galactica in the Foundation series. Finally, if you are a stranger who comes across this site by accident, I hope you can remember that **here lies (lives) the coolest, the most awesome, and the best father in the world, my father, Haoyun(Howe) Dong**.

> P.S. The source code of this site can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ss16118/the-dixie-project). It's a single-page react website that is far from being fancy. I have to apologize to my father, for I can't make his site a bit more colorful, but well, I got to say that I really did put my heart into this. As for the language, due to the sheer volume of the contents, I am sorry to say that I can't handle the translation of all 657 blog posts, so unlike my personal website, there won't be an English version.
